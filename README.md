The repository also has a folder called `Trash` (or I'll make it later anyway). It's the history of dev of second version of bot, that turned out to be incompetible with newest In$ta9ram rulles because bot is being recognised and blocked too quickly. Anyway, it has some code features I want to store somethere, as they can be applied later in other works
