# InstaBot
Selenium In$sta9ram scrapper is meant to perform several functions:
* login (both in headless and not modes)
* collect a list of followers or followings of a user
* choose randow N accounts to follow (without violation of daily limits set by service)
* perform following chosen account
* perform unfollowing unmutual followings


The repository also has a folder called `Trash` (or I'll make it later anyway). It's the history of dev of second version of bot, that turned out to be incompetible with newest In$ta9ram rulles because bot is being recognised and blocked too quickly. Anyway, it has some code features I want to store somethere, as they can be applied later in other works
